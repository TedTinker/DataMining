# DataMining
At UCSB I took a course on using RStudio for data mining and machine learning. We had five assignments:

Three homework assignments (Two completed with Lilian Lu, one with Blake Shaw)

One midterm (Completed alone) 

One final project (Completed with Lilian Lu)

Each project consists of an R Markdown file and the PDF which it results in when knit. 
Kniting an R Markdown file requires RStudio, TeX, and a variety of libraries.
