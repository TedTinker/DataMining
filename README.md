# DataMining
At UCSB I took a course on using RStudio for data mining and machine learning. We had five assignments:

Three homework assignments (Completed with Lilian Lu)
One midterm (Completed alone) (Not yet graded or uploaded)
One final project (Partner Pending)

Each project consists of an R Markdown file and the PDF which it results in when knit. 
Knitning an R Markdown file requires RStudio, TeX, and a variety of libraries.
